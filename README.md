# Docker_demo
Repo created in order to give a brief example of Docker usage.

1) In order to build the image from Dockerfile:

        docker build -t demo_image .

2) To run the container (in the circleCI feature branch this wont produce anything...):

        docker run -it demo_image

3) Observe the circleCI pipeline outcome!
